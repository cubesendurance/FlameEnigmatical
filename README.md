# Getting Started with Orca Wolf Secrets

Open up Standard Notes and paste into extension URL `secrets.sapphirepack.org/ext.json`

## Features
A general purpose password safe for the StandardNotes community.

### Storage
Storage of all secrets you can imagine in one easy to use location.

### Import
Ability to import from an unencrypted JSON export from Bitwarden along with TokenVault.

## Roadmap

No longer supported due to various security concerns with the inability to verify that this hasn't been tampered w/ OTA or from Sapphirian servers.

Current demo can be found at secrets.sapphirepack.org and extension json can be found at secrets.sapphirepack.org/ext.json
